        // in nested functions return is important to pass the value to the parent function so that it can give boolean output. here return before confirm in displayConfirmMessage2() body , gives the boolean output from confirm() to the callee of displayConfirmMessage2() now callee here is onclick function it has to use return to forward the value from displayConfirmMessage2() to browser.

<!-- browser has multiple threads(v8, webapis like settimeout) and v8 thread uses stack datastructure to run functions which are nested starting with main function and heap to store objects
    when the web apis threads are done runing they return the result wrapped in anonymous function and it gets pused into queue data structure. essentially webapis use queue. event loop another thread like render pushes anonymous function from callback queue to stack for execution when stack is empty. render thread uses render queue to render the result when the stack is empty.
